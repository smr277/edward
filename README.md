# Project Edward
##Installation
Currently, only supported on Mac, however all these steps should work on Linux as well. 

####Bazel
Download [Bazel](http://bazel.io/) and follow install directions. For bash completion, you'll need to download the source and follow instructions. 

##Editing
It's suggested to use Sublime Text 3 to edit Project Edward. This ensures that editorconfig can be used to ensure formating. In addition, there will be autocompletions written specifically for Sublime Text that plug into bazel and our headers.
